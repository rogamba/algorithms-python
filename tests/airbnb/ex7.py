"""
    Store a set of sudden-death tournament results in a 
    compact  format (eg. a bit array) and a set of predicted 
    match results (also in a bit array). 
    Score the predictions, giving one point per correctly 
    guessed match, without unpacking the bit array into a 
    more convenient format (ie. you have to traverse the tree 
    in-place).

# Algorithms & Data Structures

Recap on basic data structures and algorithms taken from different sources, mainly from the amazing book "Cracking the Coding Interview" written by Gayle Laakmann McDowell. Excercises and classes are developed in Python3.5 and almost all of the problems are explained at the top of every file.

To test the solutions run every file independently:
```python
$> python <file_name>
```

### The excercises cover the following:

* Arrays
* Linked Lists
* Stacks & Queues
* Hash Maps
* Heaps
* Recursion
* Binary Trees
* Graphs
* Sorting & Searching
* Optimization
* Multithreading

I recommend to read more about each data structure and the time complexity associated with every operation performed to have a better understanding of how efficient are the solutions.
